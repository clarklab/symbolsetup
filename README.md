symbolsetup
===========

A quick and easy plugin to include Symbolset fonts in your WordPress theme.

Use
===========

This plugin does not include the actual Symbolset font files, which you'll need to purchase from [http://symbolset.com](http://symbolset.com). Once you have the files, toss everything into the /webfonts folder, upload the plugin, activate it, then head to Tools > Symbolset to enable the fonts.

This plugin currently supports only Symbolset Standard, Symbolset Social, and Symbolset Social Circle. In the future (or when I buy the rest of the fonts) I might add support for all Symbolsets.
